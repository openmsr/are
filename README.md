cad model of the are can be found here https://cad.onshape.com/documents/b83e5f739a4507bf06f2a2a9/v/6dc1854afc8b6ad92cb34dd0/e/36d3d4af112bbf8cad7d521b. note, the step files for the simulations (found in the step_files folder) come from the for_export_2 branch. currently onshape does not properly export contained volumes, so some parts need to be modified in order to be meshed properly.
